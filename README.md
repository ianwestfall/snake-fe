# snake-fe

## What is this?
This is a Vue.js front-end for the related snake-server project. That project hosts a backend server for a WebSockets based Snake game. 
This front-end is to let me play Snake against that server, and monitor all games of Snake being played on that server, which will eventually be used to train a neural network.
